I am leaving this project at the part where I have to start working on security aspect of the spring boot application. I am getting some error with the dependencies and that's why the reason I am stopping right now.
The things completed are:
1. The basic structure of the backend has been created.
2. The codes are all working fine.
3. I have to work with the main logic part as the connections with MySQL is also looking good. To check that, go to MySQL client and check the contents of table "text" which will have contents from the test inputs
from Postman
